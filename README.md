### Usage

There is a detailed README in each directory.

`\code `directory contains our code for building the community semantic dictionary.

`\results` directory contains community dictionary and websites that contain community semantics.

You can directly use the semantic dictionary directly in the `\results` directory because the semantics of community are relatively stable.

You can also skip the first three steps in  `\code` and build community dictionary running code in `\code\4-parser`  with URLs in `\results\dictionary\community_websites.txt`.



We will continue to update this project.
